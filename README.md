A basic simple keylogger
It is important to emphasize that using or developing keyloggers without the subject's consent is illegal. Keyloggers can be harmful as they facilitate unauthorized surveillance and data theft. If you need to develop a keylogger, such as for raising awareness about cybercrime or assessing security vulnerabilities, always ensure you have proper authorization and consent from all relevant parties.
